Come morning, some of the party take advantage of the meagre bead and breakfast policy of the inn with a bowl of porridge and a mug off weak ale. As they're eating, Hiln enters the bar and asks [[Scramsacks]] for mead, who tells her there is none to be had. "No mead from [[Good Mead]]", he informs her. She tells them that recently some direwolves have taken to kidnapping children from the town of [[Dougan's Hole]] and they should go and investigate. While they are at it, Hiln encourages them to investigate why supplies aren't coming from Good Mead.  
  
They ask Hiln how many direwolves they're talking about, and her contacts tell her about 2 or 3. If they need anything they've to ask her contact, who's name is [[Uriro Rainfate]]. Hlin also tells them the children of auril have more hold over the small towns, and Dougan's Hole in particular.  
  
They leave Bryn Shander and take [[The Eastway]], a trail that connects Bryn Shander to Easthaven. It's about 6 hours walk to Good Mead. Good Mead is another small town, with about 100 people living in it.  
  
On the outskirts of the town there is a caravan circled around a tent, which appears to be merchants. As they arrive, there is a crowd of people stood around the shrine of the flaming sword. They decide to discreetly see what they are doing over there. As they approach, they see funeral rites being performed on a huge man, at least 6ft tall.  
San asks the priest who the dead man was, and the priest (of the morninglord, lathanda) says it was speaker [[Kendrick Rielsbarrow]]. San tells the priest of their mission to the south, and that they're passing through to find out why the mead isn't flowing to Bryn Shander. The priest tells them of a giant who lives in the mountains, and attacked the train taking the mead to Bryn Shander. It was fighting this giant while defending the mead hall that Kendrick was killed.  
  
The priest suggests the party go and retrieve the barrels of mead from the giant, and they will be rewarded. They decide to spend the night in Good Mead before continuing on to Dougan's Hole the next day. For the remainder of the day they'll investigate the giant in the hills. Woods asks the priest if there is any way for them to see in the dark and the priest tells them to have faith in Lathanda, the Morninglord, to guide their way.  
  
Failing to find any way of getting the morninglords blessing (without joining the priests congregation or becoming a paladin) they tie themselves together with the rope again and move on into the woods where the giant was last seen. They come across humanoid tracks leading into the woods, and as they examine them a trapper comes running out the woods telling the party not to go in the woods. All the militia the priest sent in earlier are all dead. They ask the trapper if he saw the party, and he answers that he only saw the aftermath.  
  
Lily decides to "communicate" with the fox by petting it on the head. She gets the sense the fox has seen the death that has happened recently. They decide to head on into the woods in spite of the trappers warning, and eventually they come across a set of tracks belonging to a large giant, as well as the mangled remains of the militiamen who all appear to have been clubbed to death.  
  
They follow the giants tracks deeper into the woods and the night. The blizzard is completely gone now and all the sound is the occasional whump of snow falling from the trees. Woods feels a clump of snow hit the back of his head and looks around to see if he can see who threw it. He spots slight movement and tiny tracks leading away from a nearby tree into a nearby bush. He calls after it to come out, but nothing happens.  
  
Lily, who has heard tell of little [[Mysterious Forest Beings|magical beings who live in the forest]], suggests they leave it alone, but Woods and Jack try to lure it out with food anyway. They decide to march on for about an hour.  
  
The trail culminates at a rocky hillside with pines growing around its base. Set into the hill are three caves. The frozen creek emerges from the west cave, which has a low-hanging mouth. The center cave—an eight-foot-high passage hewn from the rock—is moderately blocked by a tight stand of conifers and two massive fallen logs. The northeast cave has a big, yawning mouth, and flickers of light emanate from within. The tracks of your quarry head through this entrance.  
  
The tracks tell them which of the caves the giant is in, so they decide to head into another cave and explore. They climb over a ledge, and it all goes badly before they're able to get anywhere. They make a noise as they try to get over it quietly.  
  
They enter the cave and find themselves in a chamber with 12 burial niches on the walls. Not finding anything of interest, they decide to keep going and eventually spot a fire further along, indicating this is where the caves join up. As they are looking around, Woods hears the approach sounds of giant feet. As they are hiding, a large humanoid walks into the cave.  
  
[[Duhg|The giant]] glances over to where the party is hiding, muttering under its breath what Woods hears as "thought I heard something", to which Woods whispers back "you did".  
  
Woods reveals himself to the giant, saying they want to be friends. Unfortunately, the giant doesn't believe him and throws down.  
  
Woods opens hostilities by summoning a wildfire spirit over the top of the giant and spitting fire at it. San tries in vain to reach a peaceful resolution, but to no avail. Jack land a couple of shafts onto Duhg before retreating back into the corridor they came down. Lily does the same.  
  
Woods noticed a slight movement in his peripheral vision, and turns to see a small man made out of dried fruit. He picks it up and tosses it to Jack. He fires his longbow at the Duhg, landing a perfect hit. San also lands a hit before retreating up the corridor with the others.
  
[[Duhg's Friend]] eventually shows up and blocks them in the corridor. Jack fires a shot at it, which misses, before retreating down the corridor. Lily picks up a stone off the ground, makes it magical, throws it at Duhgs friend, then follows Jack. Woods takes a shot at the ogre before getting his phoenix to teleport him to the rest of the party. San makes like the rest of the party and executes a fighting retreat.  
  
The ogre comes round the other side of the corridor and narrowly misses Woods with its club. Lily throws another magical pebble and retreats back into the corridor. Woods thorn whips the ogre before using the phoenix to teleport him and San into the original corridor they came in.  
  
Meanwhile the ogre, unable to follow them all down the corridor, lands a javelin on Lily. Duhg has gone round and blocked the groups escape, trapping them between himself and the ogre.  
  
Duhg squeezes down the corridor and clubs Woods into oblivion.  
  
[[Firey Flappybird]] teleports the whole party to the other side of Duhg, killing the giant in the process. Friend, in the meantime, has dragged itself down the corridor and smacks Firey Flappybird to death.  
  
Lily manages to push a healing berry down Woods' throat, bring him back to life. Back on his feet, Woods finally has the chance to cast a bonfire, creating it on the ogre and finally killing it.
  
They decide to leave the cave and find a nice sheltered place to hide out that doesn't look like it's had any tracks coming or going from it.
