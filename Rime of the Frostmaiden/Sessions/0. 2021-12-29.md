While traveling to [[Northlook Inn and Tavern]] to look for work from our patron, [[Hlin Trollbane]], we came across a body being eaten by gouls in an alleyway. After defeating the gouls we investigated both the body and the surrounding area and discovered they had been dead before the gouls got to them. We found a magical ice shard embedded in the body.

We found tracks leading away from the body traced them up onto a roof beside the alleyway. 

As we were investigating, the city militia appeared and we left the scene to them, after sharing the results of our investigation with them. The body was identified by the militia as [[Gyse Genlian]].

We travel to the travel on to the inn and meet with Hlin who motions to [[Scrin Scransacks]], the Inn's proprietor, to bring food and drinks.

We tell Hlin about the situation with the gouls, and she comments that they are getting bolder by coming across the walls. We tell her about the magical ice shard used to kill him, and she tells us about a rumour about a magical being that stalks and kills those who are drawn in the lottery but not sacrificed.

[[Gyse Genlian]] was drawn in the lottery, but [[Lord Genlian|his father]] paid one of the children to have him spared. [[Bormos Gentlewhisker]] was sacrificed in his place.

She tells us to leave the situation with her, and instead give us some work. We're to investigate an iron train that was attacked by yettis. We're to rescue any survivors and bury the dead.
