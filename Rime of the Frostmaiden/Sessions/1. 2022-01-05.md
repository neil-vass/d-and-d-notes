Breakfast! The inn door opens and in walks Hlin, the party's patron, along with another Dwarf.  
  
The Dwarf introduces themselves as [[Herna Blackiron]] and is a survivor of the [[Lost Blackiron Iron Train|iron train that was attacked]]. They tell them they were attacked by a yetti who killed one of the crew.  
  
The Blackiron clan own the [[Blackiron Blades smithy|smithy]] in town, as well as a mine to the north east.  The iron train was on its way back from the mine when it was attacked.
  
Herna tells us that the train is about a three hour walk from the town by foot. Woods asks if they can loan us some dogs to pull a sledge and make the journey quicker, but most of Herna's dogs were slaughtered in the attack and they don't want to spare the remainder to strangers.  
  
Hlin and Herna take their leave, thanking the group for what they are doing and reminding them that the friendship of the Dwarves can be a valuable commodity in these times.  
  
The party agree that they should leave as soon as possible, so they can make the return trip in the same day.   
  
As the group leave the town, they step out the gates into a world of pure white. Off in the distance, they can see [[Kelvin's Cairn]] off in the distance, and somewhere between here and there is the lost iron train.  
  
As the party makes their way, a howling blizzard descends on them after a couple of hours, reducing visibility to about 20ft, and Kelvin's Carin disappears from view. Lilly, walking at the head of the column, stops the group and looks around for somewhere to shelter. They spot a statue off to the East which, upon investigation, looks like it will be enough to shelter the party from the wind. They decide it would be sensible to shelter here for some time and see if the blizzard blows itself out.
  
After a while, they hear shouting voices on the wind, coming from the East. It sounds like a group of people, and they are getting closer to where the party is sheltering. They decide to dig a hole around the statue and try and hide in it, not wanting to encounter the owners of the strange voices.  
  
The [[Mysterious hunched figure in the snow|owners of the voices]] get within about 15ft of where the party is hiding, speaking a language no one knows (Draconic). They pass on by the party, pulling a sled behind them.  
  
The blizzard ends up lasting the better part of the day, and the blizzard only passes once it's already dark. The group can see stars in the sky, and the moon is a tiny sliver, barely a crescent, so it's not casting any light over the land. With visibility reduced and most of the party lacking darkvision, they decide to stretch a rope between each other, with everyone holding onto it. Lily goes at the front while Woods goes at the back, since they can both see in the dark. Thus, they press on.  
  
They come across a dismembered corpse, surrounded by track marks of a sled that had been dragged away. Their arms have been eaten, most of the internal organs are strewn about, and there is no head. It appears this is what killed him, rather than scavenging that happened afterwards.  
  
San goes CSI:Narnia and investigates the scene, and determines that the tracks that pulled the sled away were made in the last hour. The blizzard would have covered over any tracks from the initial attack. The remaining tracks that have taken the sled lead South, and the party decides to follow them.

After half an hour, the party comes across a large wagon with two polar bears harned to it. The tracks we followed appear to belong to goblins, who are too distracted to notice they are being followed. The large wagon appears to be illuminated from within.

They plan to attack once Woods lights up each Goblin with fairy fire. Everyone quietly sneaks into position, except Groff, who screams a scream of a thousand warcries and charges towards the goblins.  
  
Lily draws first blood by shooting a goblin in the shoulder as they move to take cover behind the sled, having been startled by Groff's sign of greeting.  
  
Woods, now close enough. illuminates the group of goblins with fairy light, lighting up some who them shine light into their fellows. On that, Jackrabbit takes the shot they were holding while waiting for the illumination. The loose an arrow through the tree, instakilling one of the goblins.  
  
Groff continues to scream and charge forward, because what else is he going to do.  
  
Jack continues to skirt around the edge of the fight, killing another goblin with a well-placed arrow and nailing its body to the sledge.  
  
San finally moves into range and looses a crossbow bolt, but it thuds into the snow behind his target.  
  
Lily draws more blood by landing an arrow in another goblin.  
  
One of the goblin sounds a horn that bring two individuals to the door of the wagon.  
  
The four remaining goblins loose a volley of arrows, hitting San, Lily and Woods.  
  
Woods moves in closer and kills one of the goblins with a thorn whip.  
  
Groff continues to scream and run forward, and while he's still out of smacking range with his axe, he's within range of checking one at the nearest goblin. He downs the goblin as the axe lodges itself in the middle of its forehead.  
  
Jack stops and takes a long hard look at the figures standing in the doorway of the wagon and determines that one of them is some sort of goblin boss, based on their headdress, and he shifts his aim there. Unfortunately he misses.  
  
San moves further up and takes another shot at the goblins behind the sled, but misses again. Lily moves up behind up, takes aim at the same target, and successfully lands a shot.  
  
One of the goblins hunkered down behind the sled looses an arrow. One of them hits the enraged Groff (because you're not going to miss the big shouty man throwing axes at you from just out of arms reach).  
  
The rest of the goblins draw their swords and charge into the fray with Groff, who presumably greets them by screaming angrily in their faces.  
  
Woods takes another swipe with his thorn whip, hitting one and putting it out of the misery of its existence while singing the "your welcome" song to Groff. Groff screams (his lungs are really powerful) and battleaxes the remaining gobo in the head, but doesn't kills it.  
  
Jack takes another shot at "the dude in the big hat", a perfect criteria for choosing who to kill.  
  
San moves into a better firing position and takes a shot at the last goblin fighting Groff, felling it and taking the pressure off Groff.  
  
With all the Gobos dead, Lily takes a shot at the same target as Jack, but not knowing if it hit or not because of the distance.  
  
The wagon starts moving off into the distance, leaving the party behind.  
  
While collecting spent bolts and arrows, San manages to find 13 silver pieces between the bodies, as well as an old bell with a snowflake on it. Jack has enough religious knowledge to spot that the is of sigil of Auril the Frostmaiden.  
  
Upon investigating the sled, they find over 600lb of iron ingots stamped with the frothing ale mug that is the sigil of clan Blackiron. The hitch Groff up to the sled and reform their rope-aided marching column and head off back to Bryn Shander. By the time they make it back the aurora is glowing in the sky, and rumour has it that this is part of the frostmaiden's spell.  
  
As they pull the sled back into town, Herna thanks them for their work, handing them each a gemstone with 50 gold. Herna also offers them a 10% discount on goods bought from his shop. After taking advantage of this offer, they head back to the Inn where their food and drink is on the house.  
  
As they eat and drink, Lily pays attention to the goings on around them. She overhears a couple of people behind them complaining about how

-   Half the people of ten towns have been convinced to sacrifice food, heat and now their lives to the frostmaiden.
-   Duvessa abhores the sacrifices, but feels she must serve the will of the people
-   Fishing in lake [[Maer Dualdon]] is halted by a lake monster
-   There have been multiple murders recently

  
Meanwhile, several patrons get into a fight by the bar, one of them say "the maiden will get their due, and the [[White Walker|white walker]] will make sure of it".
  
They go to bed, and when they wake up, it's been four days since the last new moon, when the sacrifices happen.
